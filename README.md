# Yelp Search App (React Native)

This project is a practice app built with React Native, implementing a Yelp-based search functionality. It allows users to search for restaurants or businesses by location and term.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for businesses using a search bar.
- **Yelp API Integration**: Fetches data from the Yelp API to display businesses.
- **Dynamic Search**: Updates results dynamically based on user input.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages if the API call fails.
- **Custom Hooks**: Modular and reusable `useResults` hook for fetching API data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (16 or later)
- **React Native CLI** or **Expo CLI**
- **Yelp API Key** (Sign up at [Yelp Developers](https://www.yelp.com/developers))

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/yelp-search-app.git
   cd yelp-search-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the Yelp API**:
   - Create an `api` folder inside the `src` directory.
   - Add a file named `yelp.js` with the following content:
     ```javascript
     import axios from "axios";

     export default axios.create({
       baseURL: "https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses",
       headers: {
         Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_YELP_API_KEY",
       },
     });
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_YELP_API_KEY` with your actual Yelp API Key.

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android # For Android
   npx react-native run-ios    # For iOS
   ```
